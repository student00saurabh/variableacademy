        <h2>Introduction to Mathematics</h2>
        <p>Mathematics is the foundation of logical reasoning, problem-solving, 
            and scientific advancements. It is the study of numbers, shapes, 
            structures, and patterns, playing a crucial role in various fields 
            like engineering, physics, economics, computer science, and everyday 
            life.</p>

        <p>From ancient times to modern technology, mathematics has been 
            essential in shaping human civilization. It provides the tools needed
            for calculations, measurements, and complex analyses, helping us 
            understand and solve real-world problems efficiently.</p>

        <p>Mathematics is broadly classified into 
            <strong>Pure Mathematics</strong> (theoretical concepts like algebra, 
            geometry, and calculus) and <strong>Applied Mathematics</strong> 
            (practical applications in engineering, finance, and technology). 
            Whether in business, healthcare, architecture, or space exploration, 
            mathematics is everywhere, making it one of the most important 
            disciplines in education and research.</p>

    <h2>Branches of Mathematics</h2>
    <p>Mathematics is a vast field with multiple branches, each focusing on different aspects of numbers, structures, patterns, and relationships. These branches are fundamental in solving real-world problems and have applications in various fields like science, engineering, finance, and technology.</p>

    <h3>1. Arithmetic</h3>
    <p>Arithmetic is the basic branch of mathematics that deals with numbers and fundamental operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is the foundation for all other branches of mathematics.</p>

    <h3>2. Algebra</h3>
    <p>Algebra involves the study of symbols, variables, and equations to represent and solve mathematical problems. It includes concepts like polynomials, equations, functions, and matrices. Algebra is widely used in science, engineering, and economics.</p>

    <h3>3. Geometry</h3>
    <p>Geometry focuses on shapes, sizes, and properties of figures and spaces. It includes concepts like points, lines, angles, surfaces, and solids. Geometry is essential in architecture, engineering, and computer graphics.</p>

    <h3>4. Trigonometry</h3>
    <p>Trigonometry is the study of relationships between angles and sides of triangles. It is used in fields like physics, astronomy, engineering, and navigation. Trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, and tangent play a key role in many applications.</p>

    <h3>5. Calculus</h3>
    <p>Calculus is the branch of mathematics that deals with change and motion. It has two main types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Differential Calculus:</strong> Studies the rate of change of quantities.</li>
        <li><strong>Integral Calculus:</strong> Focuses on accumulation and areas under curves.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Calculus is widely used in physics, engineering, economics, and computer science.</p>

    <h3>6. Statistics & Probability</h3>
    <p>Statistics involves collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. Probability studies the likelihood of different outcomes in uncertain situations. These branches are crucial in data science, finance, research, and risk management.</p>

    <h3>7. Number Theory</h3>
    <p>Number theory deals with the properties and relationships of numbers, especially integers. It includes concepts like prime numbers, divisibility, and modular arithmetic. It is essential in cryptography and computer security.</p>

    <h3>8. Discrete Mathematics</h3>
    <p>Discrete mathematics studies structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. It includes topics like set theory, graph theory, and combinatorics. It is widely used in computer science, algorithms, and artificial intelligence.</p>

    <h3>9. Applied Mathematics</h3>
    <p>Applied mathematics involves the application of mathematical techniques to solve real-world problems in science, engineering, economics, and industry. It combines various mathematical principles for practical use.</p>

    <p>Mathematics is a diverse and essential discipline, providing solutions to complex problems in almost every field. Understanding its branches helps us appreciate its significance in everyday life and professional domains.</p>
